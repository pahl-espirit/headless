== Configuration
The setup of the {nav} for operation on a server is done by configuring the {pak}: `_{componentname}_`.

The following subchapters describe the required configuration steps.

include::chapters/projectappconfig.adoc[]

[[usage]]
== Usage
The {navm} makes it possible to query the structure of the {fs} site store of a {fs} project via the {navs}.

The following sections describe how such a navigation is created and how to optionally enrich it with additional information.

[[generation]]
=== Creation of the navigation
The navigations for the preview and release state are updated each time a page reference, structure folder or root node of the site structure has been changed or released.
Additionally, an update of the navigation is triggered by changes to pages, if the page is referenced by at least a single page reference.

When changes are made to the global URL settings of the project, both the preview and the release state are updated.


[NOTE]
Navigations are created for each language of the project as well as for each release status.

Navigations that correspond to a language that is not part of the project are deleted daily as part of a change-triggered update.

==== Resilience
Occasionally, an update of the navigation may fail for a variety of reasons.
Therefore, the process is reattempted several times over more than a day.

==== Scheduled Tasks
It is also possible to trigger the generation of the navigation by a {fs} scheduled task.
When installing the project app, two jobs are added to the project for this purpose: _Navigation Live Generation_ and _Navigation Preview Generation_.
These consist of two tasks each, which transmit the current navigations in all languages to the {nav} and delete existing navigations for which there is no corresponding language in the project.

===== Navigation at generation time
The _NavigationInspectionExecutable_ can be used to calculate the navigation tree for a specified element at generation time.
It expects the following parameters:

|===
|Name |Type |Description

|element
|en.espirit.firstspirit.access.store.IDprovider
|The {fs} element (page reference, structure folder or root node of the structure store element) for which the navigation should be calculated.

|language
|en.espirit.firstspirit.access.Language
|The {fs} language object for which the navigation should be calculated.

|key (optional)
|String
|The attribute to be returned as a result object.
If not set, the entire navigation element is returned.
|===

The return value is a JSON object. The method `.toString()` provides the serialized JSON of the object.
If the _key_ parameter is set and the specified attribute has a primitive type, a String is always returned directly.

[[custmdata]]
=== Custom Data
If the navigation data in the generated standard format is not sufficient, it is possible to add further information to the navigation.
The Navigation Service Module provides the so-called _Custom Data Script_ for this purpose.
It allows users to transfer self-defined content to the {navs}.

One use case for this is, for example, a page description, which is required in addition to the navigation information for the presentation.

The following chapter describes the setup of exactly this particular use case.

==== Setting up a Custom Data Script
Open the {sa} and add a script to your project with the following reference name: `navigation_service_custom_data`.

Within the script it is necessary to write the code into the first output channel.

[source,JAVA]
.Example implementation of a Custom Data Script
----
import de.espirit.firstspirit.access.store.pagestore.Page;
import de.espirit.firstspirit.access.store.sitestore.PageRef;

if (e instanceof PageRef) {
    page = e.getPage();
    formData = page.getFormData();
    pageDescription = formData.get(language, "pt_pageDescription").get();
    customData.put("pageDescription", pageDescription);
}
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The CustomData Script is evaluated directly after the creation with each following change at the {fs} project as well the release.

[TIP]
====
You can find all information on the use and format of the generated navigation structure in the corresponding https://navigationservice.e-spirit.cloud/docs/user/en/documentation.html[{navs} documentation].
====

In addition to the already mentioned IDProvider, other fields are available to the script within the execution context:

|===
|Name |Type |Description

|e
|de.espirit.firstspirit.access.store.IDProvider
|The current {fs} element (page reference, structure folder or root node of the structure store element).

|context
|de.espirit.firstspirit.access.BaseContext
|Instance of an https://docs.e-spirit.com/odfs/dev/en/espirit/firstspirit/access/BaseContext.html[{fs}-SpecialistBroker].

|language
|de.espirit.firstspirit.access.Language
|The {fs} language object at runtime

|customData
|Map<String, Object>
|Entries in this map are written to the custom data and then provided by the {navs}.
|===

[NOTE]
====
Please note that the maximum size of the customData map is limited to five entries.
====

The values must be equivalent to JSON primitives (e.g. String, Number or Boolean).

If you have a use case that cannot be covered by the above-mentioned fields, please contact https://help.e-spirit.com/[e-Spirit Support].

=== Content projections
In the case of a content projection for detailed views the related navigation nodes contain an attribute that can be used to resolve dynamic routes.
A content projection is regarded as a projection for detail views if the following attributes are configured in the *Content* tab of a page reference:

*The *Number of entries per page* value is greater than 0 (e.g. 1)
*The *Maximum number of pages* value is not 1 (e.g. 0)

.Content projection of a detail page view for products
image::images/contentprojection-detail.png[]

If such a content projection exists in the project, the associated navigation node contains the attribute `seoRouteRegex`.
The value of the attribute is a regular expression describing the dynamic route of the content projection.
For the above example of a detail page view for products the value `\^[\/]?products\/[^\s\/]+$` would be generated for the `seoRouteRegex` attribute.

The {nav} also supports resolving a dynamic route to the corresponding navigation node.
Further information is available in the {nav} documentation in the chapter https://navigationservice.e-spirit.cloud/docs/user/en/documentation.html#api-endpoints[API endpoints].
