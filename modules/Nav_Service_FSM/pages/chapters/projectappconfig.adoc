=== Configuration of the {nav} project component
With the usage of the {navm} the {pak} _{componentname}_ becomes available to the {server}.


[NOTE]
====
The addition of the {componentname} to a {fs} project triggers an initial creation of its navigation structure.

Removing the {componentname} will delete the created navigations in the {nav}.
====

To add the {pak}, open the `*{sm}*` and select the `*menu:{p_settings}[{pak}]*` area.

A list of all existing {pak} is displayed in the main panel.
After clicking {add}, select the `{component name}` and confirm the selection with {ok}.

This {pak} will be added to the list in the content area and must be configured afterwards (see figure <<projectcomponents_add>>).

Select the entry in the list and open the corresponding configuration dialog via {config}.

Fill in the fields as described below.

.{nav} Configuration

CaaS 3.x mode::
This mode is available in case the {server} has the {caas} module installed in a version equal or greater than 3.
If the `CaaS 3.x mode` is activated, the corresponding CaaS routes are used in the navigation as the reference to the data.
Additionally, the `Advanced URLs` UrlFactory is used for the SEO routes.

Content Reference URL Prefix::
A optional prefix can be entered in this field. The value will be prepended to the generated `ContentReference` URL of each {fs} page reference.

Content Reference URL Factory::
In this field the URL Factory which is responsible for the path generation of the referenced content can be selected.
This selection field is disabled once `CaaS 3.x mode` has been enabled.

SEO Route Url Factory::
In this field the URL Factory which is responsible for the SEO routes can be selected.
This selection field is disabled once `CaaS 3.x mode` has been enabled.

Navigation URL (release and preview state)::
These listed navigation URLs indicate the locations to which the navigations created for the project are transmitted.
These are endpoints for the front-end developers, provided by e-Spirit.

Available in languages::
This is a list of all languages of the current {fs} project, for each of which a navigation is provided.

Ignore errors::
This mode is *not recommended* and per default deactivated in all projects.
If it is enabled, errors will be ignored when generating the navigation.
Instead, _null_ values will be written to the affected locations.
You will therefore lose the certainty that data in the {nav} is always correct.

Permissions::
Here you can configure whether permissions information should be part of the navigation.
The _Input name_ defines the name of the _CMS_INPUT_PERMISSION_ input component.
Permissions will only be written to the navigation if this value is set.
The _Activity name_ specifies which set of permissions should be used.
