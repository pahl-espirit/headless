== Components
Using the {nav} in an existing {fs} project infrastructure requires two additional components

When the {navm} has been installed, a {fs} service named _{servicename}_ and a {pak} named _{componentname}_ are provided to the {server}.

{servicename}::
Upon installation of the {navm}, the {servicename} is added to the {server} and is then started.
For a transfer to the {navs} the {pak} must be added to the respective project.
The {servicename} then takes care of creating the navigations of the {fs} projects.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Only when the {servicename} is running will changes be transmitted to the {nav} .
====

{componentname}::
By adding/removing the {pak} _{componentname}_ to a {fs} project, it is regulated whether navigations are created for this project.
It has its own configuration, which is described in the chapter <<projectappconfig>>.
