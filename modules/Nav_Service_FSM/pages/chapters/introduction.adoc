== Introduction

{fs} provides its own template-based https://docs.e-spirit.com/odfs/tutorials/erste-projekt/seitenvorlage-e/navigation/index.html[navigation function] for statically generated pages.
In the modern headless world, a different solution is needed, one that seamlessly integrates a dynamic mapping between a navigation route and the corresponding content behind it.

The {navm} provides a mechanism to transfer the structure of the {fs} site store of a project into a JSON format and make it available via the {navs}.
According to the https://navigationservice.e-spirit.cloud/docs/user/en/documentation.html[documentation of the {navs}] the structure can then be queried via its REST interface.
