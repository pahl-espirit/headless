=== Architecture
The functionalities of the {nav} are realized by the interaction of different components.

These components are as follows:

* {nav}
* {navm}

The interaction of the components always follows the following scheme:

* The creation and updating of navigation-relevant content takes place at {fs}.
Changes are made available to the _{navs}_ (see _REST API_) in the context of an update.
For this purpose, the {server} creates a connection to it and transmits all relevant data.
* The {nav} receives this data and updates its internal data model based on the information provided.
* The customer's application requests the stored information as needed from _{navs}_, which provides a REST API for this purpose.
The querying of the data is performed according to the pull principle.

The communication between the {server} and the {nav} is done by HTTPS.
